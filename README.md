# Monopoly
Our project was to build a fully functional and good-looking game of Monopoly.

### Import
- pygame
- importlib

### The repository is made of :
- A python package (board_game) that contains the main classes of the game :
  - Board 
  - Player
  - Property
  - but also utils functions, a text_input file and a color file
- A lite version of the Game in the directory (Monopoly_lite) that may be tested on a terminal (Anaconda Prompt for instance)
- A complete version of the Game which is divided into two parts:
  - Minipoly.py, a smaller version of the game (beware of luck spaces !!!) 
  - Monopoly.py, the classic one (in French !!)
 
### Note : if you want to quit the game, just press (Echap) at any moment of the turn

Feel free to test everything !!!
